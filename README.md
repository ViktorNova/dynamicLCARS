dynamicLCARS
============

A web-based responsive LCARS template built with JQuery, CSS, and PHP based on Star Trek.


![Preview](http://zacharyskalko.com/files/LCARS1.jpg "Preview")
This is a preview of an early version. Currently built with [jquery.svg.js](http://keith-wood.name/svg.html). The DOM support is poor.

Currently the entire page is SVG. The objective of this project will be to reduce the SVG usage to only the [elbow elements](http://zacharyskalko.com/files/LCARS_ELBOW.jpg) unless it is possible to create them with pure CSS.


###Objective
Create a scalabe LCARS interface that will respond to the height, width, and aspect ratio of the browser viewport.

####Already have:
- SVG elements created for elbows
- A CSS stylesheet to acomplish basic themeing
- Webfont to match theme

####Need:
- Make the page layout responsive
- CMS for page content

####Want:
- Intergration with the Wikipedia API to dynamically generate library entries.

####Would be nice:
- A custom media player skin in HTML 5 to match the theme
